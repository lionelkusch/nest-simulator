Collect data from MPI communication for updating device
#######################################################

.. admonition:: Availability

   This stimulating backend is only available if NEST was compiled with
   :ref:`support for MPI <compile-with-mpi>`.

The `mpi` stimulating backend collects data from MPI channels and
updates stimulating device just before each run. This is useful for
co-simulation or for receiving data from an external software.

The creation of this MPI communication is based on the functions
'MPI_Comm_connect' and 'MPI_Comm_disconnect'. The port name is
read from a file for each device with this backend.
The name of the file needs to be specified according to the following
pattern:

::

   {data_path}/{data_prefix}{label}/{id_device}.txt

The ``data_path`` and ``data_prefix`` are global kernel properties,
while `label` is a property of the device in question and `id_device`
its node ID.
This path can only be set outside of a `Run` contexts (i.e.
after ``Prepare()` has been called, but ``Cleanup()`` has not).


Communication Protocol
++++++++++++++++++++++
The following protocol is used to exchange information between
both MPI processes. The protocol is described using the
following format for the MPI messages:
(value, number, type, source/destination, tag)

1) ``Prepare``  : Connection of MPI port include in one file (see below)
2) ``Run`` begin: Send start run (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 0)
3) ``Run`` begin: Send the id of the device to update (id_device, 1, INT, 0, 0)
3) ``Run`` begin: Receive shape of the data (shape, 1, INT, 0, 0)
4) ``Run`` begin: Receive the data for updating the device (data, shape, DOUBLE, 0, 0)
5) ``Run`` end  : Send at each ending of the run (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 1)
6) ``Cleanup``  : Send at this en of the simulation (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 2)

Data format
+++++++++++

The format of the data is depend of the stimulating device.

Parameter summary
+++++++++++++++++
.. glossary::

 label
   Shared file with ports with the format path+label+id+.txt
   Where path = kernel().io_manager.get_data_path() and the
   label and id are the ones provided for the device.
