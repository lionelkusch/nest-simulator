/**
 * Base class for common properties of Stimulating Devices.
 *
 * Stimulating devices are all devices injecting currents, spike trains
 * or other signals into a network. They provide only output and do not
 * receive any input.
 *
 * Stimulating devices come in (at least) two varieties: those providing
 * analog signals (CurrentEvent) and thos providing spike trains (SpikeEvent).
 * Device activation needs to be handled differently in both cases. The general
 * principle is that of the left-open, right-closed interval (start, stop].
 * For devices emitting spikes, spikes with times in that interval will be
 * emitted.
 *
 * For analog stimuli, e.g., currents, a stimulus is present in the
 * interval (t, t+h], where h is the simulation resolution, if the effect
 * of the stimulus can be observed at t+h. Thus, if a stimulus is to be
 * active from time a, its effect will first be observable at a+h. This
 * requires that the Event communicating the stimulus must be delivered
 * at time a, i.e., by the deliver_events() call prior to the update for
 * (a, a+h].
 *
 * Since stimulating devices are connected to their targets with a delay of one
 * time step, this means that analog stimulating devices need to emit the event
 * during the update step for the interval (a-h, a]. Thus, the device needs
 * to be PRO-ACTIVE.
 *
 * Further, activity of stimulating devices is determined on the basis of
 * simulation time, not event time stamps. This means that the first simulation
 * time step during which the device must emit events is the step for which
 * the global clock has time a-h. If stimulation is to end by time b, this means
 * that the last event should be emitted during the time step for which the
 * global clock has time b-2h.
 *
 * @note Any stimulating devices transmitting analog signals must NOT HAVE
 * PROXIES.
 *
 * @note The distinction between analog and spike emitting devices is
 *       implemented by making StimulatingDevice a template class with the type
 *       of the Event sent as template parameter. Member is_active() is not
 *       implemented in general and is available only for those cases for which
 *       it is explicitly specialized.
 *
 * @note StimulatingDevice inherits protected from Device, so that
 *       implementations of is_active() can access t_min and t_max.
 *
 * @todo The timing of analog devices is correct only if they are transmitted
 *       using Network::send_local(), but we cannot enforce this currently.
